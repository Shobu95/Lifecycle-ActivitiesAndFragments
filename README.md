# Lifecycle-ActivitiesAndFragments
An android project which helps understand the lifecycle method callbacks of actvities and fragments.

The app provides flows such as opening fragments over activities and vice verse. The user can observe what lifecycle callbacks are fired when user performs these flows.

Each callback method is captioned with a block comment explaining when the callback is called and what sort of code should be executed in them.
